			<h2>Welcome to my website!!!</h2>
			<p>I was born and raised in San Jose, CA. I graduated college in 2014 with a bachelors degree in web design and a minor in computer engineering. I love coding and my aspiration is to become a web developer. When I'm not coding your webiste you can usually find me practicing martial arts, traveling, or enjoying fine beer.</p>
			<p>This is my first attempt at creating a personal website. It's far from perfect and I promise you that more will be added. In the meantime if you would like to contribute please check out <a href="https://github.com/mjcampos/Profile-Page">my github account</a> and fork the site.</p>
			<p>There's a lot more to say but I don't really know where to begin. Ask me something and we'll start from there.</p>
			<p>If you want to contact me please email me at camposmj89@gmail.com. I usually answer my emails within a day.</p>
